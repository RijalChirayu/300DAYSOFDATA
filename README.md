<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p>
 I learned about neural networks and logistic regression. In the logistic regression I learned to implement the gradient descent algorithm with Regularization. Learned to implement simple neural networks in Tensorflow.

<h3>Day 2</h3>
<p>
 I learned about forward propagation from scratch using python. Learned about Linear Discriminant analysis and bayes classifier.

<h3>Day 3</h3>
<p>
 Its day 3 and I learned so many things today. I first learned about different classification models.Logistic regression , LDA, QDA , GLM and Naive Bayes. I implemented the code for the models with the help of ISLP book.
